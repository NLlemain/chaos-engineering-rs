- **‚ö° High Performance**: Rust-powered with async/await, minimal overhead (~15MB memory, <1% CPU)
- **üéØ 7 Chaos Types**: Network latency, packet loss, TCP resets, CPU starvation, memory pressure, disk I/O, and process kills
- **üìã YAML Configuration**: Simple, declarative test scenarios with multi-phase support
- **üîÑ Reproducible Tests**: Deterministic chaos with configurable random seeds
- **üìä Multiple Output Formats**: Real-time CLI progress, JSON, Markdown reports, and Prometheus metrics
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safe by Design**: Input validation, no shell injection, clear privilege separation
- **üß™ Testing Built-In**: Example target services and comprehensive test scenarios included

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+** - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Platform-specific** (for network chaos):
  - Linux: `iproute2`, `iptables` (usually pre-installed)
  - macOS: `dnctl`, `pfctl` (built-in, requires sudo)
  - Windows: No additional requirements (uses application-level simulation)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NLlemain/chaos-engineering-rs
cd chaos-engineering-rs
cargo build --release
```

Build takes ~30 seconds. Binaries are located in `target/release/`.

### Your First Test

```bash
# 1. Start a test HTTP service
./target/release/axum_http_service

# 2. In another terminal, run a quick chaos test (3 minutes)
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/quick_test.yaml --verbose

# 3. Try the comprehensive stress test (15 minutes)
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/stress_test.yaml --verbose --output-json results.json
```

That's it! You'll see real-time progress and a summary of how your service handled the chaos.

## üì¶ Chaos Injectors

| Injector | Description | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **network_latency** | Adds configurable delay to network packets (mean + jitter) | Linux: `tc/netem` ‚Ä¢ macOS: `dnctl` ‚Ä¢ Windows: app-level |
| **packet_loss** | Randomly drops packets at specified rate | Linux: `tc/netem` ‚Ä¢ macOS: `dnctl` ‚Ä¢ Windows: app-level |
| **tcp_reset** | Forcibly terminates TCP connections | Linux: `iptables` ‚Ä¢ macOS: `pfctl` ‚Ä¢ Windows: app-level |
| **cpu_starvation** | Saturates CPU cores at specified intensity | Cross-platform busy loops |
| **memory_pressure** | Allocates memory to target usage percentage | Cross-platform heap allocation |
| **disk_slow** | Introduces I/O latency to disk operations | Cross-platform synchronous I/O |
| **process_kill** | Terminates and optionally restarts processes | Platform-specific signals/APIs |

All injectors work on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** with platform-optimized implementations.

## üìù Creating Test Scenarios

Chaos tests are defined in simple YAML files with a multi-phase structure:

```yaml
name: "HTTP Service Resilience Test"
targets:
  - name: "web_api"
    type: "process"
    process_name: "axum_http_service"

phases:
  # Phase 1: Establish baseline metrics
  - name: "baseline"
    duration: "30s"
    
  # Phase 2: Inject network latency
  - name: "network_stress"
    duration: "60s"
    injections:
      - type: "network_latency"
        target: "web_api"
        delay: "100ms"
        jitter: "20ms"
  
  # Phase 3: Combined resource pressure
  - name: "resource_stress"
    duration: "60s"
    parallel: true
    injections:
      - type: "cpu_starvation"
        intensity: 0.7
      - type: "memory_pressure"
        target_usage: 0.8
        
  # Phase 4: Verify recovery
  - name: "recovery"
    duration: "30s"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Validate scenario before running
./target/release/chaos validate scenarios/my_test.yaml

# Run with real-time output
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/my_test.yaml --verbose

# Generate reports in multiple formats
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/my_test.yaml \
  --output-json results.json \
  --output-markdown report.md \
  --verbose
```

### Available Output Formats

- **CLI**: Real-time progress bars with colored output

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework is organized into five focused crates:

```
chaos-engineering-rs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chaos_cli/          Command-line interface and user interaction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chaos_core/         Core chaos injection engine and injectors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chaos_scenarios/    YAML parser, test orchestration, and phase management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chaos_targets/      Target discovery and example test services
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chaos_metrics/      Metrics collection, aggregation, and export

+ scenarios/            Pre-built test scenarios
+ scripts/              Helper scripts for common tasks
```

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Async-First**: Built on Tokio for concurrent multi-target chaos injection
- **Modular Design**: Each crate has a single responsibility
- **Type-Safe**: Leverages Rust's type system for correctness
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new injectors and metrics exporters

## üîß CLI Commands

```bash
# List all available chaos injectors with descriptions
./target/release/chaos list

# Validate a scenario file (syntax and configuration)
./target/release/chaos validate scenarios/my_test.yaml

# Run a chaos test
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/my_test.yaml [OPTIONS]

# Run with multiple output formats
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/stress_test.yaml \
  --verbose \
  --output-json results.json \
  --output-markdown report.md

# Dry run (validate without executing)
./target/release/chaos run scenarios/my_test.yaml --dry-run
```

## üß™ Test Services

The framework includes three example target services for testing:

### HTTP Service (Axum)
```bash
./target/release/axum_http_service
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**macOS**
- Uses native `dnctl` and `pfctl` for network chaos
- Requires `sudo` for network injections
- All tools built-in, no installation needed

**Windows**
- Application-level network chaos simulation
- No elevated privileges required for network chaos
- Ideal for local development testing

## ‚ö° Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Binary Size** | ~6 MB | Optimized release build |
| **Build Time** | ~30 seconds | Full `--release` build from clean |
| **Memory Footprint** | ~15 MB | Idle, excluding injected chaos |
| **CPU Overhead** | <1% | Framework overhead during chaos |
| **Startup Time** | <100ms | From invocation to first injection |
| **Compilation** | 0 warnings | Clean build on stable Rust |

**Designed for minimal overhead** - the framework itself won't be the bottleneck in your tests.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Security

### Best Practices

**Chaos engineering is powerful - use it responsibly:**

1. **Start in Non-Production**: Always test new scenarios in dev/staging environments first
2. **Progressive Intensity**: Begin with low chaos intensity and short durations
3. **Active Monitoring**: Watch system metrics during chaos tests
4. **Have a Kill Switch**: Know how to stop tests immediately (`Ctrl+C`)
5. **Staging Data Only**: Never test with production customer data
6. **Document Findings**: Record what breaks and how to fix it

### Privilege Requirements

| Operation | Linux/macOS | Windows | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Network chaos | `sudo` | User | Linux/macOS modify kernel networking |
| CPU/Memory/Disk | User | User | Standard process operations |
| Process kill (own) | User | User | Normal process management |
| Process kill (other) | `sudo` | Admin | Cross-user process termination |

### Security by Design

- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: All YAML configs validated before execution
- ‚úÖ **No Shell Injection**: Uses Rust's safe `Command` API
- ‚úÖ **Privilege Separation**: Clear boundary between user and root operations
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logging**: All chaos actions logged with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Deterministic Behavior**: Reproducible tests with seed values
- ‚úÖ **Zero External Dependencies**: Core functionality requires no external services
